# Curriculum Inventory APIs

Health professions education programs frequently use an ecosystem of educational technologies to deliver and manage their curriculum and related resources and activities. Many institutions have curriculum management systems that help them to manage the structure and content of the curriculum. In numerous cases, separate systems will each offer assessment, evaluation, and supplemental content or activities.   
MedBiquitous Curriculum Inventory APIs are designed to allow for effective communication with and delivery of data from a standards-compliant curriculum management or curriculum inventory system. The links below provide documentation for Curriculum Inventory operations.
